I am planning to make a metallurgy calculator. So far, you can smelt 2 metals together and have the script tell you the purity of the alloy divided into the purity and weight of each metal part inside the alloy :)

Not much to say just... Keep the .exe and .dll in the same directory / folder else it shits itself
